<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of <a href="https://yuwangsjtu.github.io/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Yu Wang (王钰)</a>. I received my Master’s degree in the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. I received my Bachelor’s degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2017.

🔬 My research focuses on:

- Large Language Models

- Knowledge Argumentation

- Dialogue Systems

- Retrieval Augmented Generation
